1. The first step towards our Btech project is to exploit all the vulnerabilities as highlighted in document provided.
2. First step is to accumulate all the programs which highlight this vulnerabilities.
3. Main source of these programs is https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/type/Vulnerability/RSPEC-4432 .
4. The above mentioned site mainly contains all the non-complaint solution which is a vulnerable one and its complaint version.
5. Once all the programs have been collected they have to accumulated in an application program which contains all these vulnerable codes.
6. Before starting the building of application program. The BTP project mentor has to be briefed about the source of the programs.
7. Furthur briefing of the project is to be taken from the instructor before proceeding.
